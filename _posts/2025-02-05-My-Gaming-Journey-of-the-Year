Oh boy, I could probably talk for hours about this since I played A LOT of games last year. However, there are games I played that hits me the most. I would like to start from what I consider my guilty pleasure lol. For my guilty pleasure it will be Call of Duty. I know I’m late from the party, but my first Call of Duty game was modern warfare 3. I have a love or hate relationship for that game mainly because sometimes it can get too competitive. It was the source of my fun and stress lmao. Mostly, I play that game when I want to release some stress. It helps, but after a few gaming sessions I’ll quit especially when I start feel stressed about it. I believe that games should be a way to relieve stress, not the reason to feel stressed. Call of Duty gives me both of those feelings lol but overall it’s good, it gives me shits and giggles.


Now, for the game that blown me away game design wise would be Middle-Earth: Shadow of War. the amount of replayability from that game is nuts! Mainly because of the nemesis system. It works like if you failed to kill an enemy, it will make a procedurally generated dialogue. This leads to different cinematic lines like you the player has been reported and their comrades will get a revenge or if sometimes there’s a point where you can kill the enemy but then they will run away just for you to face them again with a missing limb or an eye from your previous battle. I do wish all of RPG games have that feature because it can give unexpected lore with hundreds of hours of gameplay. Sadly, the nemesis system is patented by the Warner Bros. Imagine what are we going to experience on games if they didn’t gatekeep it.


That’s my take for my year in gaming for 2024. I am excited for my year in gaming for 2025 since there are games that I am patiently waiting to be released especially Monster Hunter Wilds and GTA 6!
