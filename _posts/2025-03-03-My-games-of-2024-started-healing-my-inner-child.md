2024 was surprisingly one hell of a year, probably why I stuck to mostly cozy games at the time. I wasn't really much of the type to see which games are trending, or which games are newly released. It was 99% waiting for Steam sales, window shopping, drooling over my wishlists that I've been craving to get. ;-; But hey, all was worth it!

The games I played earlier that year were mostly management simulation games, but my favorites of all time were **CHANGE: A Homeless Survival Experience**, and a few from the Kairosoft franchise like **Game Dev Story** and **The Manga Works**. Eventually I got to try **Supermarket Simulator** by the end of the year, too. These games really just hit the spot of being able to lock in, plus my hoarding and grinding obsessions were satisfied to the core. (yes, the majority of my lifespan was spent on these games until my brain rotted)

It doesn't end there. By August, I managed to play and get three of my most awaited games: **Risk of Rain 2, GTA IV,** and **Until Then**. I was particularly aiming for GTA IV for a long time, it was a big nostalgia hit of being able to play GTA again. The whole experience was truly a classic like people say, and for the most part, it just reminded me of the days I play games at a pisonet (a computer rental place we call in the Philippines) with my cousins as a kid.

Overall, my game experiences in 2024 were mostly healing the little kid in me. But I look forward to diversifying the games I play more this year! I figured studying games from different genres would help a lot, especially with the game we're working on this year. It's just fun to think that playing games is part of our work, and I'd call it "research." LOL

That's it for me. To more fun and games this year! :D
